# EV Population Data Analysis

## About

This project EV Population was collected and downloaded from Electric Vehicle Population from data.gov. Thank you to William for uploading the file on kaggle for people in the community to have access to this dataset. Kaggle Electric Vehicle Population

This project aims to discover EV adoption in various states, and postal codes. Some limitations in the dataset include diversification of states: Washington (WA) accounts for 99.8 percent of the total data. Moving forward, we will be focusing on WA as our primary EV adoption. 

## Purpose of the Project

As an Analyst with a passion in motor vehicles and energy solutions to help improve fuel economy. The major goal of this project is to gain insights into the adoption of EV to understand the demands and growth. The project identifies the popularity of a manufacturer's make and model.

When organizing my table information, I actively think about questions to understand the dataset more.

## Business Question & Objectives
General Questions:
1. How many unique states, cities, make models, and ev types does the data have?
2. Which state has the highest adoption of EV?
3. Which EV is the most popular among all make and models?

Descriptive Analysis:
